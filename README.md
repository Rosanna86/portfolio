# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio with a collection of my latest projects in frontend development. The portfolio will be updated weekly during the bootcamp with new projects and interesting articles. 

# The projectÂ 
A lot of effort in this project was put in responsive design and accessibility. I've used Lighthouse, Wave and W3C's validators for HTML and CSS in this project to check for errors and issues with performance, accessibility and validation. I have also checked the page and it accessibility in Firefox and Edge. The code was validating without a few errors, and after fixing some issues with image sizes, font sizes and color contrast I received the following points fromn Lighthouse:

* Mobile: Performance: 100, Accessibility: 96, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 90.
* Desktop: Performance: 100, Accessibility: 96, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 90.
